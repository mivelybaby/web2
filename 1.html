<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>What is HTML?</p>
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>
HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.<br>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br>
HTML elements are represented by <> tags.<br>
An HTML element is a start tag and an end tag with content in between.<br>

<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
